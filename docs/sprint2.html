<h2>Sprint Two</h2>
 <p>
      
 The middle of Sprint two marked the beginning of a nationwide lockdown as Covid-19 hit our shores. As we were given a few days notice before the lockdown began I made it a priority to set up remote access for myself and my team mates, and made a simple instructional document in addition to adding steps to documentation. I considered this to be a helpful professional contribution as not everyone was familiar with RDP and SSH tunnelling. 
 <br><br>
To say that lockdown hindered my progress is an understatement, in addition to the disruption of routine arose a myriad of technical challenges to get an app I was only semi-familiar with working from home and/or remotely. Setbacks included migration errors that was solved by a team member by switching from sql to sqlite3, learning how to simulate payloads and having my C drive on my Polytech machine die. As it stands I am using one of our sysadmins test machines to access network features. The timing of our sprints were also affected as the holidays were brought forward, bringing our sprint to a halt. In retrospect continuing the sprint probably would have been a better approach, keeping motivated & working with other motivated individuals can make a huge difference in work output.
<br><br>
I became very stuck on the sensors web app project in my attempt to get the time a payload was sent so a user could determine the accuracy of the sensor readings. There's not a lot of excuses for my lack of progress during this sprint other than I was still learning the flow of the application; Django, TTN and mqqt were all new languages and platforms to me. I also struggled at first when I came to transition from using relational databases to using Mongo DB which is document oriented. 
<br><br>
Towards the end of the second sprint I became aware that GitLab does not allow Developer users to create new repositories & branches. As this is the first Group Project I have ever administrated on Gitlab I was unsure what developers could and couldn’t do. In addition to doing some searching I also asked one of my team mates to do some tests with me as she too had a developer account. We decided the best thing to do was to make everybody a owner and have asked that users only delete from projects they have created.
<br><br>
Though the situation of working from home for a minimum of one month is daunting, it's also an opportunity to acquire new skills. For example I am picking up little tricks that make my life easier like adding programs to right click menus so I didn't have to cd into my development directory every time I opened my virtual environment, or how to simulate data payloads from TTN which I have added documentation for. I plan on documenting skills I have picked up as  result of studying in lockdown throughout the upcoming sprints.
