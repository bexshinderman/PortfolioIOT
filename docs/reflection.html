 <h2>Reflection </h2>

 My time spent in the IOT has helped me identify that my passion is in the backend side of code, and that I want to persue a career in sysadmin & DevOps. Because of this, I will likely change teams next semester to specialize said skills. There have been many times within IOT that I have felt out of the loop or even useless because I have never worked with hardware before. Almost all my peers had atleast taken embedded systems or been into tinkering in one way or another. One thing I really regret about the covid situation was not being able to extend these skills or work in the tool room. Next semester I definitely aspire to learn how to use the 3d printer and basic circuitry. 
 <br>   <br>
 There have been many times within the semester that I have felt like I was going to fail Project 1 and that I wasn't good enough - but around the end of Sprint 3 I managed to increse my technical contributions and gained confidence as we approached Sprint 4. I think I felt like I had most become a useful part of the team when team members started messaging me for technical help. I also seemed to be the point of call for git related problems as well. Towards the end of the semester I felt like I was able to take on slightly more of a leadership role within server and git related areas.
 <br>   <br>
 Communication among the team has been really tricky and I mostly put this down to the social and physical restrictions that covid imposed on the semester. I think the hardest part was when I became stuck on technical problems, help was really hard to get because for the first time I had to articulate each and every problem and could only supplement my descriptions with screenshots (screensharing is not all that it's cracked up to be). I attended every webex meeting with my team throughout the semester as that face-to-face time became so crucial. Having the oppertunity to talk instead of type was definitely a huge benefit to me. A fellow team mate Prasanth & I met a handful of times through out the semester and would work on things through screensharing. There are so many adaptations we have had to make working remotely this semester, and I am relieved to now be on the other side of it.
 <br>   <br>
 Though our progress has been significantly impacted by covid, I am proud of the contribution my active team mates & I have made. I believe come next semester that the new IOT team members will be able to follow the documentation a lot more easily and because of our good communication within git, that they will be able to easily build on things too. I guess this semester was more of a maintence semester than anything. I am super looking forward to hopefully being on site next semester, I found working at my home desk incredibly distracting and at times felt unimmersed in my work.
 <br>   <br>
 My overall experience, despite the ups and downs, has been a positive one and I believe I have made reasonable technical and professional contributions to my team. I also feel like the code and documentation I have left behind can be easily built on. In saying this, there's so much I can improve on next semester and I believe that by spending more time on campus next semester I will be able to better immerse myself in my chosen Project. I need to spend a lot more time researching what I'm working on and instead of heading straight to stack overflow to look at the docs as well so I fully know what's going on.
