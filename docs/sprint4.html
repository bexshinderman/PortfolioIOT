 I have decided to focus myself on more backend oriented tasks in order to get some momentum going. For now I have put the ticket I was stuck with on the backburner and have considered how I can make my contributions more meaningful to the team. Up until a week ago all I had really contributed is git migration + setup, and that didn't sit right. Partially I put this down to being overwhelmed by a new project & working on other peoples code for the first time, but realistically I was stuck. 
  <br>   <br> 
 Since starting to do more server stuff I have noticed my contributions have increased and I am now working on documenting how to deploy the room-sensors web app in a fresh ubuntu environment. I have been working this out on a VM so as not to rupture the preexisting production server. As we now have a brand new staging server I am hoping my documentation will be used by a peer to put the room-sensors web app on the staging server.Because of this, I'm making sure to keep my documentation as simple and as thorough as possible, keeping in mind future students who will be using the docs as a go to. 
  <br>   <br>  
 I learned some cool things about python a long the way and became more comfortable using docker to serve and build files. The cool thing about the development server is we will be able to run simultaneous docker containers at once, and when the reverse proxy my peers are working on we will be able to share the same port, which is pretty cool. One setback I have had is figuiring out how to deploy the dockerized web app on the hosts' ip instead of localhost. To my suprise this was done within the front-end node files, as well as in the backend. My next hurdle was something called a CORS error which is when the cross-origin request is blocked. It is a security feature, and can be ammending by 'whitelisting' the hosts' ip address in the backend .
  <br>   <br>  
  I am quite proud of this documentation as I did not have a lot to go off in the first instance and it felt good to be able to write instructions for code that I had not written myself. My team mate was able to successfully recreate my steps and my merge request was accepted. The room-sensors app is now on the development/staging server and can be visited internally on the polytech network.

  I have been doing my best to to communicate as much as I can through gitlab as things easily get lost in Microsoft Teams. In addition to adding little bits of documentation to the readme's as I come accross inconsistencies, I have also been trying to communicate effectively in both tickets and merge requests.
