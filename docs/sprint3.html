 <h2>Sprint Three </h2> 
 <p>
    
Sprint 3 was a particularly challenging time as I became burdoned by a ticket I was struggling with. Initially I came into the team with the intention of working on DevOps, but had found myself stuck on a web issue. This made me realise how important it is to be a Jack of all trades in IT. Towards the end of Sprint 3 I thought I had completed this ticket - but upon a long & thorough code review performed by Project Manager I realised my work was not up to scratch. Learning to be on the receiving end of a code review is a humble exercise - but I appreciated the experience. My only concern was when features would creep into code reviews because the original ticket was not written well enough. Had I have known the scope of the ticket I picked up I probably wouldn't have put my hand up. After having gone through this experience I have been extra careful to write comprehensive tickets & have not been afraid to ask people what it is they are really asking for. 

In consideration to agile, I am still yet to meet or hear from our client. Interestingly within this project it seems our project leader is also shadowing the role of client. A number of times I have had to decide that something's out of scope, or point to other preexisitng issues when features began to creep into code reviews. As project is supposed to be akin to a real world development cycle - I believe this to have been a good exercise of confidence and has also caused me to consider the project holistically, as opposed to just the issues that directly impacted what I was working on at the time. Issues I addressed during this code review included redundancy (DRY), comments & code that shouldn't have been there, and small security issue.

Though I thought I completed the task, my project manager reveresed the approval as they were the datatypes I had outputted. I had outputted the time as a sting which I learned was bad practice as obviously you can't perform calculations on a string. Upon hitting a bit of a brickwall with python and timezone conversion I moved on to other tickets in the name of momentum, and let the priority of displaying time slide. I started to work on backend & sysadmin related tasks, and began familiarizing myself with the server side of the Orokonui server. The first two things I immediately noticed was a) the git origin on the server was incorrect, it was still pulling from the OP gitlab even though we had migrated to gitlab.com, and b) there was absolutely no diskspace to the point I couldn't even tab. I made the corresponding tickets and did some diagnostic probing trying to find what was taking up the space. During a screen-sharing conference call the next day I was able to determine that there was over 20 gigabytes of unused docker images from the previous semester. Changing the git origin was an easy fix, I made sure to check the room-sensors server as well which unsurprisingly also had the wrong origin. It felt good to contribute to my teams success after a few stagnant weeks.
